Key modifiers are things like Shift or Num Lock that change the meaning of some keys when they're held down or toggled on.  Tea::Kbd::Down and Tea::Kbd::Up events provide modifier information.

The following constants are valid modifiers that also happen to match their keys.  Like the [[Key Constants]], they also live in Tea::Kbd, so the left Shift  key would be Tea::Kbd::L_SHIFT.

L_SHIFT
R_SHIFT
L_CTRL
R_CTRL
L_ALT
R_ALT
NUM_LOCK
CAPS_LOCK
ALT_GR

These extra constants can used for convenience. They also live in Tea::Kbd, but aren't physical keys.

SHIFT
CTRL
ALT
